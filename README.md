# Rob's Gitting Started

This entire project is starting out as an opinionated, specific guide for "Future Rob". "Present Rob" has been using SVN and would like to change, so this is mostly a beginner's guide, but also it is a re-brainwashing document.

But who cares? Let's see the **topics/scenarios** that I want documented.

- Start a new project from scratch
- Make a change to an existing project
- TODO: what next?

## Start a new project from scratch

Start with a non-existent folder and end up with a repo on GitHub.

1. Create the folder while initializing a brand-new repo.
```
> git init git-docs
```

2. Navigate to the folder.
```
> cd git-docs
```

3. Open in VS Code.
```
> code .
```
